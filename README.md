Hi, this is Joshep üñêÔ∏è

I've been leraning python for 4 years now, and trying to master my skills by the time you read this. I am also learning JS and Lua.

At the moment I'm working in a discord bot using the [PyCord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) python library.

An other proyect I am developing, is a [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) server, but of course I am always opened colaborate in any project (preferably related with web development, or python-orientated ones).

You can contact me through my discord `Josesitos#7091`, but pls don't spam and be specific or I'll ignore or block you.
