- Hi, here's Joshep

- I am currently learning about the library [discord.py] for learning to code discord bots. 
- I rearelly collaborate with people to code, but if you have a good idea or project I am always apoen open to hear them.
- If you would like a discord bot you can contact me through: Discord -> José manuel#1394
