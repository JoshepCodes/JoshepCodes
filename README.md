Hi, this is Joshep üñêÔ∏è

I've been learning python for `5` years now, and I am trying to master my skills by the time you read this. I am also learning Java and JavaScript as well as SQL.

At the moment I'm working in a discord bot using the [PyCord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) python wrapper for discord api. But I am open to any interesting coding poject (preferably related with web development, or python-oriented ones).

You can contact me through my discord `Josesitos#7091`, but pls don't spam and be specific or I'll ignore or block you.
