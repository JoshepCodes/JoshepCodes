Hi, this is Joshep üñêÔ∏è

I know python, and I am trying to master my python skills. At the moment I am also learning Lua and JS. Actually I am working in a discord bot using the [PyCord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) python library.

An other proyect I am developing, is a FiveM server, but of course I am always opened colaborate in any project (python base one, preferably).

You can contact me through my discord, but pls don't spam and be specific or I'll ignore or block you.
